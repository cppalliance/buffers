= Dynamic Buffers

While buffer sequences are useful for transporting raw bytes across function
boundaries, they can only represent sequences of fixed size. To allow the
creation of sequences whose size can change, we adopt the "dynamic buffer"
concept introduced in Boost.Asio. A dynamic buffer represents memory regions
which may be automatically sized as required.

* A dynamic buffer has an input sequence defined as a _ConstBufferSequence_

* A dynamic buffer has an output sequence defined as a _MutableBufferSequence_

* Callers acquire the output sequence by calling `prepare(n)` where `n` is the
  desired size.

* Callers invoke `commit(n)` to move written bytes from the output sequence
  to the input sequence.

* The input sequence is returned by calling `data()`

* The input sequence is released by calling `consume(n)`
