= Boost.Buffers

This is a portable C++ library providing containers and algorithms for
describing contiguous buffers of arbitrary bytes, with these notable features:

* Requires only C++11
* Works without exceptions
* Fast compilation, few templates
* Does not require Asio or Boost.Asio

== Requirements

* Requires Boost and a compiler supporting at least C++11
* Link to a static or dynamically linked version of this library
* Supports `-fno-exceptions`, detected automatically

== Tested Compilers

Boost.Buffers has been tested with the following compilers:

* clang: 3.8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
* gcc: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
* msvc: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3

== Quality Assurance

The development infrastructure for the library includes these per-commit analyses:

* Coverage reports
* Compilation and tests on Drone.io and GitHub Actions

== Credits

This library is based on concepts and code developed
by Christopher Kohlhoff and published in Boost.Asio.
